/**
 * GameState is an observable object that exists in the server
 *      When the client wants to take an action, they call to the server (using the command
 *      pattern (Command, ShootCommand, GrabCommand, etc)), which forwards the command
 *      to the game state.
 *      The gameState executes the command, which can update data such as:
 *          Location of the player
 *          State of the player (inventoryItems, health, etc)
 *          State of the game (In Progress, Over, Goal Achieved, etc.)
 *      The gameState returns a state for the server to process and update the client with:
 *          ...
