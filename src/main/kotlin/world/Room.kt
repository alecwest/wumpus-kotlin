/**
 * Some features of the Room that will differ from the c++ implementation:
 *      Rooms cannot know their coordinates. This knowledge shouldn't be passed down to a Room.
 *      Rooms cannot know the world size as well as the number of rooms in the world.
 *      A room only contains information on what exists inside it.
 *      It is up to the client to determine any "status" or "inferences" about any room.
